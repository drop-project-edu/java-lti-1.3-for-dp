# LTI 1.3 & LTI Advantage Java Library

This is a fork of the LTI 1.3 library, with no source code modification, just for convenience, to be used by Drop Project.

## Install
This library depends on two additional libraries:

* [LTI 1.3 core](https://github.com/drop-project-edu/java-lti-1.3-core-for-dp)
* [LTI 1.3 JWT](https://github.com/drop-project-edu/java-lti-1.3-jwt-for-dp) for testing

It can be installed using maven:

    <dependency>
	    <groupId>org.dropproject</groupId>
	    <artifactId>lti-13-for-dp</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.0</version>
	</dependency>
